E-Waste Facility Locator
## Problem Description
Website that tells you the location of the nearest e-waste collection and recycling facility.

## Idea

How about a straightforward, user-friendly app where you type in your location and it instantly shows you the nearest e-waste recycling centers or drop-off points? It could also provide basic guidance on how to prepare your electronics for recycling. This way, people can easily find convenient and responsible ways to dispose of their old gadgets, promoting environmental sustainability and reducing electronic waste pollution.
